Alongside my work as a System Engineer (with a focus on Kubernetes) at
PostFinance, I'm married to a farmer in Switzerland, and live with her and her
family on the family farm. \
This is quite different from my daily work, and I sometimes have the
opportunity to help by, for example, feeding calves during milking, using my
skills to install surveillance cameras, deploying a long-distance WiFi network
across the farm, or modernizing the milking monitoring. \
It's this latter point that I'm detailing today (without all the technical
details, which are covered in the
[README](https://github.com/clementnuss/alpro-openmetrics-exporter) of the
open-source project I've created for this purpose).

## The milking on the farm

My wife and her family milk 65 Holstein dairy cows daily, at 5:30 in the
morning and at 4:30 in the evening for the evening milking. Milking data is
recorded in a software called Alpro, which hasn't been updated since 2009.

The software provides a lot of information about the cows, such as the quantity
of milk for each milking, the amount of concentrate distributed to the cow, the
duration of the milking, the number of days since the last calving, etc.

Although this data is interesting, accessing it requires connecting to the
computer and using the old software with its outdated interface. Therefore, I
became interested in trying to import milking data into a time-series database,
so that I could later visualize this data with modern software that I use and
appreciate daily: Grafana.

### Importing Access Data

To do this, I looked into the database used by the Alpro software, which is a
fairly old Access database but can still be opened with software such as
MDB/ACCDB viewer on MacOS, Microsoft Access, or with the excellent open-source
software [mdbtools](https://github.com/mdbtools/mdbtools).

The process for extracting Access data and converting it to
OpenMetrics/Prometheus format is as follows:

1. I backup the Alpro database files using the open-source software
   [restic](https://restic.net/), which allows me to easily make incremental
   backups every 15 minutes to an S3 server (in this case, Cloudflare R2, with
   a generous free tier), and which automatically manages backup rotation.
1. Within a Kubernetes CronJob, I download the latest backup and convert the
   access `.mdb` files into an `SQLite` database.
1. a [python3
   script](https://github.com/clementnuss/alpro-openmetrics-exporter/blob/main/alpro-to-openmetrics.py)
   opens the `SQLite` database with the [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
   library, parses the timestamps, filters erroneous/missing data, and finally
   produces OpenMetrics records which look like follows:

```

1. I upload those records to my preferred time-series database:
   [VictoriaMetrics](https://victoriametrics.com/)

### Data Visualization

Since the milking data is available in VictoriaMetrics, I can use
[Grafana](https://grafana.com/) to visualize it. I could potentially create
alerts in the future, for example, when it takes significantly longer to milk a
cow than the previous day, or if the average milk production over 3 days drops
significantly.

As Grafana is a web-based graph visualization solution, it's now possible at
any time to check the production of each cow, production trends, average
milking duration, etc. And this can even be done from a mobile phone!

I'll conclude this article with an overview of the visualization. The next
episode will focus on farm's methanization plant!
